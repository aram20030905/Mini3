Key Components
Footer: Displays copyright and social media images.
Navigation: Contains links to different sections of the app (product, contact, etc.), and displays the shopping cart icon with the number of items.
Product: Displays a list of products fetched from a mock backend API and allows users to add them to their cart.
Admin: Admin users can log in, and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the products.
Cart: Displays the user's cart, allowing them to adjust product quantities or delete items.
Work: A page showing various work categories like "Shop", "Factory", "Delivery", and "Technical Service", each leading to job listings.
Development
Adding New Jobs
To add a new job category:

Create a new component similar to existing ones (Xanut, Araqum, etc.).
Add a section inside the component with job title, description, and salary information.
Use buttons or forms to allow users to apply (with navigation to the Contact page).
Admin Product Management
The admin section allows adding products through a form and manages product data via mock API (http://localhost:8000/productData).
Users can upload product images, and the admin can modify product data.
Cart Functionality
The cart allows users to add and remove products. The quantity of each product can be adjusted, and the total price is calculated dynamically.

Known Issues
Product image uploads are local to the frontend; images aren't saved permanently.
Limited form validation (currently no error handling for incorrect form data or failed network requests).
Some visual components (e.g., buttons, input fields) may not be fully responsive on all screen sizes.
Future Improvements
Implement authentication for admin and regular users.
Store cart data persistently (in localStorage or a backend).
Add detailed error handling and validation for forms.
Expand the API to support more advanced features like user accounts and payment processing.
